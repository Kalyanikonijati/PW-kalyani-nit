Playwright is an open-source Node.js library for automating web browsers. It was developed by Microsoft and provides a high-level API to interact with web pages and perform browser automation tasks. Playwright supports multiple web browsers, including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

Key features of Playwright include:

Cross-browser Testing:

Playwright allows you to write browser automation scripts that can run on different browsers. This helps ensure that your web application works consistently across various browser engines.
Headless and Headful Modes:

Playwright supports both headless (without a visible browser UI) and headful (with a visible browser UI) modes. This flexibility is useful for different testing and automation scenarios.
Automated Testing:


Playwright is often used for end-to-end testing of web applications. You can simulate user interactions, navigate through pages, and validate the behavior of your application.
Scraping and Data Extraction:

Playwright can be used for web scraping and data extraction tasks. It allows you to programmatically navigate websites, interact with elements, and extract data.
Capture Screenshots and Record Videos:

Playwright provides built-in capabilities to capture screenshots and record videos during test execution. This is valuable for analyzing test results and debugging.
Performance Testing:

Playwright can be used for performance testing by simulating real user interactions and measuring the response times of web applications.
